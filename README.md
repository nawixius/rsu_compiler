## Features
- Simple scripting syntax with Rust's performance
- Memory safety guarantees
- Easy integration with Rust ecosystems
- Fast prototyping capabilities

## Quick Start Guide

### Running the Compiler
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd)
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run the compiler: `rsu_compiler your_program.rsu`

### Compilation Output
- Generates temporary executable: `temp_code.exe`
